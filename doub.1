.TH DOUB 1
.SH NAME
\fBdoub\fR \- prints doubles

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdoub\fR [-r] [DIR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdoub\fR is a hack overusing checksums to print files with the same
content in a directory or a directory tree, all duplicates in the same line,
separated by colons.
Without the option '-r', this is done only in the directory DIR, with '-r',
this is done recursively in DIR.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBuniq(1)\fR, \fBdu(1)\fR

.SH BUGS
It is quite slow, mostly because of the hash-sum generation.
.P
doub can't deal with directories named '-r'.
