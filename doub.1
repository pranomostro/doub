.TH DOUB 1
.SH NAME
\fBdoub\fR \- prints doubles

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdoub\fR [-r] [DIR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdoub\fR is a program overusing checksums to print files with the same
content in a directory or a directory tree, all duplicates in the same
line, separated by colons.
Without the option '-r', this is done only in the directory DIR, with
'-r', this is done recursively in DIR.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBuniq(1)\fR, \fBdu(1)\fR

.SH BUGS
It is quite slow, mostly because of the hash-sum generation.
.P
\fBdoub\fR can't deal with directories named '-r'.
.P
The output is colon-separated, which doesn't work quite well with
filenames containing colons. But the PATH variable does this as well,
so it seems the best option.
.P
There is a very unlike chance of false positives because there is no
checking of the file contents, they are only compared with their
hashsum.
