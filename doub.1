.TH DOUB 1
.SH NAME
\fBdoub\fR \- prints doubles

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdoub\fR DIR [-r]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdoub\fR is a hack overusing checksums to print files with the same
content in a directory or a directory tree, keeping always one of the
duplicated files. Without the option '-r', this is done in the directory
DIR, with '-r', this is done recursively in DIR.

.SH "SEE ALSO"
\fBuniq(1)\fR, \fBdu(1)\fR

.SH BUGS
No bugs have been discovered yet, but back up your stuff anyway! It is a bit slow, but scales pretty well.
