Did you ever have a huge directory structure, preferably a music collection,
but unfortunately some duplicate files in duplicate directories?

If the answer is yes, this might be for you!

This shell script prints the duplicates in your directory (structure), making
it possible to process these files later on, whatever you like to do with them.
You can pipe the output to `xargs rm`, just touching them or any other task.

So, if you need it, don't hesitate to try it. It's free.
