Did you ever have a huge directory structure, preferably a music collection,
but unfortunately some duplicate files in duplicate directories?

If the answer is yes, this might be for you!

This shell script deletes the duplicates in your directory,
while keeping always one instance of every file, only depending on
the contents of the file and not the name.
And here comes the clou: it can even do that recursively!

So, if you need it, don't hesitate to try it. It's free.
